# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

The "Online Store" project involves developing an e-commerce platform software system. The system aims to provide an online marketplace where users can browse and purchase products conveniently. It solves the problem of physical distance and limited store hours by enabling users to shop anytime and from anywhere. The system's stakeholders include customers who want to buy products, sellers who wish to list and sell their products, and administrators who manage the platform and ensure its smooth operation.

## Requirements
REQ-1:
Description: The system should allow customers to create user accounts.
Type: Functional
Priority: 1
Rationale: User accounts enable personalized experiences, order history, and secure transactions.
Testing: Verify that customers can successfully create new user accounts and log in.
REQ-2:
Description: The system should provide a product search functionality.
Type: Functional
Priority: 2
Rationale: Search functionality allows customers to find specific products quickly and efficiently.
Testing: Test the search feature by entering different keywords and verifying that relevant products are returned.
REQ-3:
Description: The system should support secure payment processing.
Type: Functional
Priority: 3
Rationale: Secure payment processing ensures customer trust and protects sensitive information.
Testing: Perform payment transactions using different payment methods and validate the successful completion of the transactions.
REQ-4:
Description: The system should be able to make cancelations.
Type:Functional 
Priority: 4 
Rationale: System should allow customers to adjust their orders of a previously made purchase 
Testing: Verify that the customers can succesfully cancel an order 
REQ-5:
Description: The system should provide authentication when making a purchase
Type:Functional 
Priority:5
Rationale: Verifying that the customer is who they claim to be 
Testing: Testing credit card information and login credentials 
REQ-6: 
Description: System must send a confirmation email when a customer places an order 
Type:Functional 
Priority: 6
Rationale: The store must allow for customers to sign up with email. 
Testing: Place an order with the email that the user has given 


Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like REQ-1, REQ-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Description:** A short description of the requirement. This should be a single sentence that describes the requirement. Do not replace the word `Description` with the actual description. Put the description in the space where these instructions are written. Maintain that practice for all future sections.
  - **Type:** The type of requirement. Should be either `Functional` or `Non-Functional`.
  - **Priority:** The priority of the requirement. This should be a number between 1 and 5, with 1 being the highest priority and 5 being the lowest priority.
  - **Rationale:** A short description of why the requirement is important. This should be a single sentence that describes why the requirement is important.
  - **Testing:** A short description of how the requirement can be tested. This should be a single sentence that describes how the requirement can be tested.
- **ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like REQ-1, REQ-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Description:** A short description of the requirement. This should be a single sentence that describes the requirement.
  - **Type:** The type of requirement. Should be either `Functional` or `Non-Functional`.
  - **Priority:** The priority of the requirement. This should be a number between 1 and 5, with 1 being the highest priority and 5 being the lowest priority.
  - **Rationale:** A short description of why the requirement is important. This should be a single sentence that describes why the requirement is important.
  - **Testing:** A short description of how the requirement can be tested. This should be a single sentence that describes how the requirement can be tested.

## Constraints

Budget Constraint: the total amount of combination of goods a customer may purchase 
Customer Satisfaction Constraint: measures how the customers expectations correspond to the result 


In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.

## Use Cases
UC-3:
Description: Customer Checkout and payment
Actors:Customer
Preconditions:The customer accesses the cart and proceeds to checkout
Postconditions: The customer applies detailed information of payment to buy products at checkout 

UC-4:
Description: Customer reviews 
Actors: Customer 
Preconditions: The customer goes to reviews selection/category of store 
Postconditions: The customer writes an honest review of product on the site


In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the use case. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like UC-1, UC-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Description:** A description of the use case that gives the user a high-level overview of how the system is interacted with.
  - **Actors:** A list of the actors that are involved in the use case. Only include the actors that are directly involved. Actors are the people or things that interact with the system. For example, when ordering at a fast food restaurant, one might have the following actors: the customer, the cashier, and the cook. But only the customer and the cashier are directly involved in the use case of ordering food. The cook is not directly involved in the use case of ordering food.
  - **Preconditions:** A list of the preconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the preconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met before the use case can be executed. Continuing with the restaurant example, the customer must have money in their wallet and the cashier must be logged in to the system before the use case of ordering food can be executed.
  - **Postconditions:** A list of the postconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the postconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met after the use case has been executed. Continuing with the restaurant example, the customer must have their food and the cashier must have the customer's money after the use case of ordering food has been executed.

## User Stories

US-3:
ID:US-3
Type of user: Customer
Description: I want to be able to cancel my order that has been placed and also be refunded because I chose the wrong size of the product so that I can select the right product. 

US-4:
ID:US-4
Type:Seller
Description: I want to be able to allow customers to leave an honest review of my product to show reliabilty and gain trust from my customers. 

In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the user story. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like US-1, US-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Type of User:** The type of user that the user story is for. This should be a single word that describes the type of user. For example, a user story for a customer might be `Customer` and a user story for an administrator might be `Admin`.
  - **Description:** A description of the user story that gives a narrative from that user's perspective. This can be any length, but it must paint the picture of what the user wants to do, how they intend to do it, why they want to, and what they expect to happen.

## Glossary

In this section, you should list any terms that are used in the document that may not be immediately obvious to a naive reader. Each group member must supply at least one term. Each term should be written in the following format:

- **Term:** The term that is being defined. This should be a single word or phrase that is being defined.
  - **Definition:** A definition of the term. This should be a short description of the term that is being defined. This should be a single sentence that describes the term.

Try to only list terms that a naive user would not understand.
